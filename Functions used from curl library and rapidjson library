Functions from the `rapidjson` Library:

1. **`Document::Parse(const char* json)`**:
   - Use: This function is used to parse a JSON string and populate a `rapidjson::Document` object with the parsed data.
   - Description: It takes a JSON string as input and parses it, creating a structured representation of the JSON data that can be 
   easily accessed.

2. **`Document::HasMember(const char* memberName)`**:
   - Use: This function is used to check if a JSON object has a member with the given name.
   - Description: It returns `true` if the JSON object has a member with the specified name and `false` otherwise.

3. **`Value::IsArray()`** and **`Value::IsString()`**:
   - Use: These functions are used to check the type of a JSON value.
   - Description: `Value::IsArray()` checks if a JSON value is an array, and `Value::IsString()` checks if it's a string. These checks are  
   used to ensure that the JSON data is of the expected type before accessing it.

4. **`Value::GetString()`**, **`Value::GetInt()`**:
   - Use: These functions are used to retrieve the values of JSON members of specific types (string or integer).
   - Description: `Value::GetString()` retrieves the string value of a JSON member, and `Value::GetInt()` retrieves the integer value.

Functions from the `curl` Library:

1. **`curl_easy_init()`**:
   - Use: This function is used to initialize a libcurl easy handle, which is used to make HTTP requests.
   - Description: It sets up the libcurl environment and prepares it for making HTTP requests.

2. **`curl_easy_setopt(CURL* handle, CURLoption option, parameter)`**:
   - Use: This function is used to set various options for the libcurl handle, such as the URL to request, callback functions, and more.
   - Description: It configures the behavior of the libcurl handle, allowing you to customize how the HTTP request is made.

3. **`curl_easy_perform(CURL* handle)`**:
   - Use: This function is used to perform the HTTP request with the configured libcurl handle.
   - Description: It initiates the HTTP request, sends it to the specified URL, and receives the response. The response data is stored 
   using the callback function provided.

4. **`curl_easy_cleanup(CURL* handle)`**:
   - Use: This function is used to clean up and release resources associated with the libcurl handle when you're done with it.
   - Description: It frees memory and resources used by the libcurl handle, ensuring proper cleanup.

5. **`size_t WriteCallback(void* contents, size_t size, size_t nmemb, string* output)`**:
   - Use: This is a custom callback function provided to libcurl. It is called when libcurl receives data from the HTTP response, and it's 
   used to store the received data in a string.
   - Description: The function appends the received data to the `string* output`, and its return value indicates how much data was processed.

These functions collectively allow the code to make an HTTP request to the Google Books API using libcurl, receive the JSON response, and then parse 
and extract information from the JSON response using the `rapidjson` library.*/
